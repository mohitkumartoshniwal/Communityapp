Made during **Rackathon 2018** hackathon with the help of my teammates.This app is based on Android platform. This app is a one stop place for 
Donation(given by ngo apps, people in general), Sharing(giving a peace loving environment) and Selling(similar to other apps in the market). This app helps to build a community around it.

Ok, so the basic layout of the app was designed by me( What things fit in what places and what components to be used,all that kind of stuff) since it was my idea in the first place so I was better able to get the vision of how I want the app to look like at the end but my teammates had helped me in the brainstorm process. I will list out the things done by each team member along with the techstack of the app. 

Beware this is a very basic app.

I might have forgot some more basic stuff.
Well, it is a basic app but I am ok with that, since it is a starting point for me.



**My summary:**


I did not know much about Android development except taking first two basic courses of it in Udacity and watching some videos of the rest of the three basic courses(If someone doesn't know much about [Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/), it is a very good site and has a variety of courses, so explore it but don't get overwhelmed by the amount of courses). Then in the diwali holidays of 2018, I watched around 60-70 videos of a Youtube channel, [slidenerd](https://www.youtube.com/user/slidenerd), it was awesome for me since I knew the basics of java, it was like a breeze for me and flowed all of my doubts along with it,which I had, after watching Udacity's videos. So for a beginner, I would suggest watching some of Udacity's course(almost all courses have a freeware version) and if you know java,only then go for slidenerd, otherwise you will understand things partially. I have at present done an Android app internship with a company named **TrestleLabs** under the mentorship of one of my faculties in my college's ISE department, **Dr. Mydhili K. Nair**  and I learned a lot of basic stuff while implementing stuffs required by me in that internship, a lot of those things had helped me in developing this community app .
