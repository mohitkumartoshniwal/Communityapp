Made during **Rackathon 2018** hackathon with the help of my teammates.This app is based on Android platform. This app is a one stop place for 
Donation(given by ngo apps, people in general), Sharing(giving a peace loving environment) and Selling(similar to other apps in the market). This app helps to build a community around it.

Ok, so the basic layout of the app was designed by me( What things fit in what places and what components to be used,all that kind of stuff) since it was my idea in the first place so I was better able to get the vision of how I want the app to look like at the end but my teammates had helped me in the brainstorm process. I will list out the things done by each team member along with the techstack of the app. 

Beware this is a very basic app.
